/* Problem 5
Temperature Range: determine if a given temperature is within a
comfortable range for outdoor activities. If the temperature is between 65Â°F
and 85Â°F (temperature >= 65 && temperature <= 85), it's considered
comfortable. If it's outside this range, it's either too hot or too cold for
outdoor activities. */
